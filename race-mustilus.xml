			<h4>MUSTILUS NAMES</h4>
			<p>At birth, a Mustilus pup is given a name by their parents. When they reach the age of adulthood, they perform a task seeking wisdom and a vision from their patron or matron spirit. Everyone is given a different task to complete. It's never a task of great strength or ability so much as one given to find themselves and their place within the tribe or elsewhere. Once the task is fulfilled, the shaman or priestess who gave the task gives the individual a new nickname representing their achievements, their guide's request, or even a particularly strong quirk that defines them.</p>
